# FEED READER TESTING 
## Project Abstract
In this project, we were supposed to write the test suites using Jasmine [Behaviour-Driven Javascript] (http://jasmine.github.io/) for the web application that reads the RSS feeds and keeps on updating as content changes.


## Why this Project?

Testing is the most important while building an application. As this explains how application behaves when operated by different users. As the number of user increases, we would never want our application to fail lately. 
We use Jasmine for creating test suites and making different situations which might occur and handle these situations correctly.
